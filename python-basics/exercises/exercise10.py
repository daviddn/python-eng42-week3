# Story book!

# Create a dictionary with 3 stories inside! Like a book :)
# each story should be its own dictionary with:
    # beginning, middle, end
    # hero

# Iterate over the book, and prin out each story! PRINT ALL of them :)
# Formatted of course

# hints:
    # you already built a dictionary with a story
    # you already have something to prompt user for input & build dictionaries
    # Now what we want is to create a book that hold 3 stories

# extra:
    # stick it in a while loop so we continue to listen to stories :)
    # it would be nice to be able to read only one story
